## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript

### What I learned

I built this project while referencing Srimba's tutorial (https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel).

In particular, I learned how to use ARIA attributes to improve user accessibility, how to overlap HTML elements to create compelx layouts with css grid, and how to support responsive images using the picture element.

My biggest takeaway from this project is learning to build a css design system that promotes reusable code.
